#How do I approach designing software?
#What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

Developing this project has helped by showing me how to create 3D shapes with only triangles. By having these 3D shapes, I can code around these objects to make a more complex environment.

#What design process did you follow for your project work?

My design process was to make all the necessary functions to make all the shapes. Then I could place and move these objects around the scene until I was satisfied.

#How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

In future work, by having all functions availible, it will be easier to micromanage the scene until it is done.

#How do I approach developing programs?
#What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

I did not use any new development strategies. All strategies used were based on common C language and best practices.

#How did iteration factor into your development?

As the weeks progressed, during this project, my approach changed. At first, I was frustrated because the code never worked. As a result, I changed my approach to simplify the proplem. This lead to the code working. After this, I expanded what I knew worked and eventually solved all the problems I had previously. As I progressed, these small changes lead me to completing the project.

#How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

My first approach was to envision the end result and code to get to there. This was not feasable because I didn't know enough about how opengl functioned. I had to lower my standard until the code worked. After that my approach was to build and test the code repeatedly to see what worked, and what didn't. By testing this way, I learned more about what opengl accepted, and what it didn't.

#How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
#How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?

By struggiling during this project, it made me analyze the code more thoroughly and critically think more about why the code might have an error, or why that method worked over another. Teaming that mindset with 3D shapes in a 3D environment made this a unique opertunity to test my critical thinking skills in a 3D environment. By analyzing code critically, this will help learn new coding approaches and/or new programs.

#How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

By developing my critical thinking skills, this will be very helpful in a professional setting. I will not need to rely on others to explain sections of code to me. Instead I will just use the critical thinking strategies that I learned here.
